- Also upload the useful modules personally made during the projects.
    - As the most of the modules are not publicly releasable due to the secrety issue, here may include only a part of the modules that were self-maded.
    - The details of the projects will be described in the github.io.

- Most of the codes are written in `python` language, and the modules are all .py file.
    - pytest still has not been implemented. If you want to know how to use the modules of each project, see the .ipynb files and refer to the detail usage.
    - Or, each project may have README.md file in it. It may also be a useful guide.
